v2.22 - Updated for iptables 1.4.3 and 1.4.4.  Organized files for older 
iptables releases using a similar system as the kernel patches.


v2.21 - Updated for Linux 2.6.27 and 2.6.28.  Removed #if 
LINUX_VERSION_CODE statements that can't ever be true because of how 
these patches are organized.


v2.20 - Cleaned iptables files.  For iptables 1.4.1.1 forward, removed 
.layer7-test, fixed help text, conformed to current negation convention 
('!' flag goes before options rather than between option and argument), 
and so forth.  Now distributing xt_layer7.{c,man} as individual files 
rather than a patch.  No change to kernel patches.


v2.19 - Update iptables patch for iptables 1.4.1.1.  Note that iptables 
now uses a different compile procedure.  Corrected MODULE_VERSION 
numbers on all kernel patches.


v2.18 - Updated 2.6 patch for 2.6.25.  Removed a stray "asdf" from 
2.6.22-2.6.24 patch.


v2.17 - Updated 2.6 patch for 2.6.24.


v2.16.1 - Fixed and expanded documentation here and in README.


v2.16 - iptables patch: Added a patch that works with iptables 1.4.0rc1.


v2.15 - 2.6 patches: Added /proc/net/ip_conntrack code in the new place that 
it has to be for Linux 2.6.20 and up.  Tested with 2.6.20.8, 2.6.21.1, 
2.6.22-rc7 and 2.6.23.1.


v2.14 - 2.6 patches: Added missing dependency (NF_CT_ACCT) and fixed 
Makefile in 2.6.20-21 and 2.6.22.


v2.13 - 2.6 patch: Fixed compiler error on 64 bit platforms.


v2.12.1 - Fixed documentation on iptables patch to reflect correct kernel 
version boundary.


v2.12 - Updated iptables patch.  Now there are two iptables patches, one 
for kernels before 2.6.20 and one for 2.6.20 forward.


v2.11 - Added missing nf_ct_l3proto_module_put() call to 2.6.20/2.6.21 
patch. Added patch for 2.6.22.  Some stylistic changes to 2.6 kernel 
code.


v2.10 - Added a missing check to the pattern parsing code in iptables. 
Updated kernel patch for 2.6.20+, using paranoid locking. Some stylistic 
changes to 2.6 kernel code. No changes to 2.4.


v2.9 - Changes to 2.6 version: Implemented "unset" which matches 
connections which are still being tested with no match.  No changes to 
2.4 version or iptables.


v2.8 - Changes to 2.6 version: Removed checkmatch() from ipt_layer7.c 
(fixes iptables' "Invalid argument" problem) and surpressed compiler 
warning about non-const skb in match().  Removed stray_code, since the 
new port is to userspace, where this is not necessary either.


v2.7 - In 2.6 version, ipt_layer7 now automatically loads ip_conntrack. 
No changes to 2.4 version or iptables.  Updated documentation slightly.


v2.6 - No functional changes, just changed one line to conform to 2.6.18.


v2.5 - Changes to iptables only

- iptables now allows spaces or tabs after the protocol name in the
protocol files.  This allows, for instance, "http " or "http I am the
coolest!!!" instead of just "http" in http.pat.  Pattern writers should
stay conservative in what they send, however.


v2.4.1

- I had accidentally overwritten the 2.4 patch with a newer version of the
2.6 patch.  Oops!  It is now restored.


v2.4 - Changes to 2.6 version only

- Changed to using Deti Fliegl's match_globals in the regexp code
for SMP safeness.  (The code as a whole is still probably not SMP safe.)

- Added Deti Fliegl's "if(!master_conntrack->layer7.app_data) return 0;"
to add_data.

- Removed whitespace at ends of lines to make quilt happy.


v2.3 - No functional changes

- Updated patch for 2.6.17.


v2.2

- Fixed type mismatch in debugging printk.

- Updated for minor formatting changes in 2.6.16 that broke the old patch.


v2.1 - iptables now issues warnings when regular expressions contain hex
codes that are regexp control characters or null.  No change to kernel
patches.  (Noted that kernel patch is now tested with 2.6.15.)


v2.0 - No big changes.

- iptables used to ask for --pattern if it didn't get --l7proto.  Fixed.

- Kernel patch is now aganst 2.6.14.  This is just cosmetic, it still works
with 2.6.13.

- Cleaned up some #ifdef stuff in ipt_layer7.c

- Added version information to kernel module.


v2.0-beta - The maximum number of bytes examined can now be specified at
module load time (rather than compile time).  Increased the default
numpackets to 10.


v1.5 - No functional changes.

- Updated 2.6 kernel patch for new lock syntax.

- Removed init() from iptables (not necessary).

- Made debugging messages less enthusiastic.

v1.4 - Changed NSUBEXP back to 10 since it looks like our regexp library
can't actually handle higher numbers properly.  No change to iptables.


v1.3

- Brought the 2.4 patch up-to-date with the 2.6 patch.  It now contains
all the features that 2.6 does.  (The 2.4 version still does not use
CONFIG_IP_NF_CT_ACCT, so it is not necessary to apply that patch to make
l7 work.)

- Increased NSUBEXP from 10 to 16 in regexp.h to allow for longer
regular expressions.

- Removed extraneous .orig file from the iptables patch.

- Module unloading in 2.4 now works.


v1.2 - Bug fix release:

- Fixed another (smaller, but significant) memory leak in 2.6 kernel. 
The fix is a bit of a hack and I'd like to fix it in a more satisfying
way later.

- Fixed compilation of 2.4 kernel on RH9 and other systems by adding
another #include to ipt_layer7.c

No change to iptables.


v1.1 - Added patch for Linux 2.6.11.X.  No real changes.


v1.0.1 - Bug fix release:

- Fixed memory leak in kernel.  

- Fixed iptables crash on AMD64. 

- Fixed kernel compilation problem on AMD64.

This release does not yet work with Linux 2.6.11.X.  Wait for v1.1 if
you need that.  (Should be soon.)


v1.0 - No changes to 2.4 version or iptables.  Shuffled around a bit of code
in the 2.6 version so that it could patch cleanly to both 2.6.9 and 
2.6.10.  Included the previous version of 2.6 patch so that people using 
2.6.0-2.6.8 don't have to get an older package.


v1.0-rc1 - No changes to the 2.4 version or iptables.  For 2.6:

- Connections that have no match and are no longer being tested are now
marked "unknown". 

- Now uses (and depends on) "Connection tracking flow accounting"
(CONFIG_IP_NF_CT_ACCT). 

- Skbuffs are now linearized and error messages are net_ratelimited.


v0.9.2 (retroactive) - Added a #include to 2.4 kernel patch so it would 
compile for more people.


v0.9.1 - Changes to ipt_helper.c that aren't part of l7-filter had crept
into the 2.6 patch of v0.9.0.  They are now removed.  No other changes.


v0.9.0 - 2.4 version now should compile correctly if l7-filter is
built-in. Fixed a significant bug which caused some patterns not to work
(tolower was munging 'upper ascii' characters).  No change to iptables.


v0.8.2 - Iptables now uses modular man pages (as of v1.2.10).  The iptables
patch now conforms to this new format.  No change to kernel.


v0.8.1 - Made code slightly more paranoid about running out of memory.  No 
change to iptables.


v0.8 - Small improvements to locking code.  All kmallocs should be
checked now. Converted the regexp code into this century's C syntax. 
Added a patch for Linux 2.4.  No change to iptables.


v0.7 - Improvements to locking code.  No change to iptables.


v0.6.1 - Fixed places where iptables used --l7-proto instead of --l7proto.
No change to kernel.


v0.6 - Significant kernel code cleanup.  Attempted to make code SMP safe with
spin_lock() and GFP_ATOMIC.  No change to iptables code.


v0.5 - Initial release in this format.
